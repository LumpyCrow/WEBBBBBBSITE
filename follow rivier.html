    <div id = "story"> Lil tim follows ze riber, but his dumb ass trips and falls in. luckily for Tim, he is naturrally a super goo swimmer and can not drown in water. unluckily for Tim, the rivier is super beefy. (Strong) (Fast) so he has trouble getting out! so lil' Tim is drifting very far into the rivr. but wait! he sees a boat in the distance! should he try getting onto it?</h3>
