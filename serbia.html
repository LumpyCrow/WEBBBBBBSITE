    <div id = "story"> Tim, not knowing how to sail a boat, accidentally caused the ship to start flying away! how embarassing! about 20 minutes later, he ended up in Serbia, a landlocked country. worse yet, he ended up in Serbia. Tim has 10 minutes to live before he succumbs to Serbia poisoning (due to the high serbia concentrations in the air). Think fast! what does he do?!</h3>
