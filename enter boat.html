    <div id = "story"> Tim climbs onto the boat. on the boat, there are pirates! doesn't make much sense why there are pirates here but what tim DOES understand is that these pirates have a lot of booty (treasure). one guy said "what the hell is this lil guy doing with a balloon on our boat?!" there are 6 crew members on the pirate ship. all armed with swords. Tim has a balloon and is much smaller than these guys. should tim try to fight them anyways and steal their boat and teasure?</h3>
